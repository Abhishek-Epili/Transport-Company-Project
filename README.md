# Transport-Company-Project
Here is a project for Transport Booking System for two modes- bus and airways. I have used java servlet to implement the above project.
It is a web application which has user interfaces for admin and user, where user can login and book tickets for bus or airways. User can also give feedback. Whereas admin can see the whole data of user's logged in, bus_tickets booked, airway_tickets booked, feedbacks given by user.
Here are the screenshots for some of the pages.
